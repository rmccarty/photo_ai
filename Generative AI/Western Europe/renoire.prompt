Edit the provided photograph to reflect the artistic style of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Apply painterly, luminous effects that capture Renoir’s warm, romantic impressionism. Use soft-focus brushwork with radiant highlights, gentle tonal transitions, and a sun-drenched glow throughout the image. Emphasize warmth in color—particularly creamy pastels, rose tones, and golden light. Soften all hard lines and fine details, replacing them with blended forms and delicate texture. If figures are present, render them with fluid outlines and glowing skin tones. Remove any modern elements and blur rigid geometries to evoke a more organic, 19th-century atmosphere. Maintain or exceed the resolution and perspective of the original image.
