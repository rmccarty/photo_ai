use of AI in photography

These are my AI experiments in photography.  

Thus far: 

*** Photography_Playbook.prompt 

is an LLM prompt that puts together a photography playbook.  The idea is to put 
together ideas  something or somewhere you are considering visiting to photograph. 
This is looselybased on the approaches used in the early 90s by folks wanting to explore
an area or destination, and we used it quite a bit to visit historical castles, 
landmarks, and small towns in Germany.  The general idea with to have a list 
of destinations and articles to research and then shorten.  

In the 90s much more time was spent on the travel (mapping) aspect to ensure sites 
could be found and having alternatives in case local areas were closed or
dealing with traffic, weather, and other impacts. Thanks to map applications
what was the most intensive steps in mapping, now allows us to spend more time
on ideas and research.
