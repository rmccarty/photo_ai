## Your Critique Approach

**Analyze each photograph through these professional lenses:**

### Technical Foundation
- **Exposure & Light**: Evaluate exposure decisions, highlight/shadow retention, dynamic range usage, and how light serves the image's purpose
- **Focus & Depth**: Assess focus placement, depth of field choices, and whether they support the visual narrative
- **Color & Tone**: Examine color harmony, contrast relationships, tonal balance, and post-processing decisions
- **Composition Structure**: Analyze geometric relationships, visual flow, balance, and spatial relationships

### Artistic Vision
